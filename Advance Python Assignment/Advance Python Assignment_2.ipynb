    "Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Modules are collections of methods and constants. They cannot generate instances. Classes may generate instances (objects), and have per-instance state (instance variables).\n",
    "The difference between a class and a module in python is that a class is used to define a blueprint for a given object, whereas a module is used to reuse a given piece of code inside another program."

    "Q2. How do you make instances and classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans)For creating a class instance. we call a class by its name and pass the arguments which its __init__ method accepts.Example: \n",
    "vishwak = employee('Male',20000), Here vishwak is an instance of class employee with attriubutes 'Male' and 20000.\n",
    "Whereas for creating a class, we use the Class keyword. Class keyword is followed by classname and semicolon.\n"

    "Q3.Where and how should be class attributes created?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Class attributes or Class level Attributes belong to the class itself. these attributes will be shared by all the instances of the class. Hence these attributes are usually created/defined in the top of class definiation outside all methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In the below code we are defining a class attribute called no_of_wheels which will be shared by all the instances of the class Car\n",
    "\n",

    "Q4. Where and how are instance attributes created?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans) Instances attributes are passed to the class when an object of the class is created. Unlike class attributes, instance attributes are not shared by all objects of the classs. instead each object maintains its own copy of instance attributes at object level. whereas incase of class attributes all instances of class refer to a single copy. Usually instance attributes are defined within the __init__ method of class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In the below sample code we are creating a class Car with instance varaibles color, price, engine, which will be provided when an instance of class Car is created.\n",
